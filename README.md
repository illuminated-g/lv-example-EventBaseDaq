# lv-example-EventBaseDaq
LabVIEW Project that demonstrates the difference between Event driven data acquisition and standard DAQmx usage

A MAX configuration file (.nce file) is included to make it easier to setup the 32 simulated devices this example expects to be able to use. If not customizing the example, ensure that the configuration is imported in MAX so that the example can run as-is.
